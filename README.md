# CSGO-Arms-Fix
Fixes overlapping of custom arm/glove models.


Known Bugs

• When choosing "Default" in the KGNS Gloves plugin menu, the gloves will be invisibile. Thinking of a fix. Meanwhile, use gloves cause the default ones are ugly.
• Sometimes, the world model of the glove is invisibile. Usually when choosing the default model and it lasts until next spawn.
